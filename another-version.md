# **My NYSC Experience: From Glitches to Growth**

My NYSC story didn’t start with camp, platoons, or wearing khaki, it started with a stubborn server and the fear of missing registration again. I experienced a lot of phases in this journey and i have categorised them into the journey.

## **1. Registration: A Battle Between Me and the Portal**

After my Batch B experience—where I arrived late and registration had already closed I promised myself I wouldn't repeat the same mistake. So on November 12th, I had gone to the University of Ibadan a day earlier to stay at a friends place and at around 6:40am i got to the cybercafe only to meet about eight people already waiting. so I went back to the Student Union Building where I was charging my laptop. When he finally came, he began distributing numbers and tags. Unfortunately, the number I received on my return was higher than the one I got earlier when he hadn’t arrived yet.

The major part of the registration was biometric capturing. I had captured earlier during the Batch B Stream II registration, and I thought I was to continue from there, but they convinced me I needed to capture again. I paid for the new capturing, but when it was my turn, the system detected my previous capture. I proceeded with the proper registration, only to discover another issue: my portal wouldn’t allow me to complete the process.

At some point, people who arrived hours after me were getting their registration done and leaving. Meanwhile, I was still stuck in one spot, trying not to panic. That was when someone—Agboola Oluwadamilola—simply asked, “Are you sure there’s nothing you missed?” It wasn’t a technical solution, but it calmed me enough to start troubleshooting properly.

I checked the portal myself and saw a box I had ignored before:
**“Did not complete previous registration.”**
I ticked it.
Error gone.
Registration done.

I even ended up helping others who had the same issue.

By November 25th, around 1:20 a.m., my posting dropped: **Oyo State.**
I packed my bag. Camp was next.

## **2. Camp in Iseyin: New Faces, Freezing Weather, and Finding My Rhythm**

I left for camp early on November 27th with my friend Felix. At the park, we met someone who would later become important in my NYSC journey—Timothy.

When we got to the Iseyin camp, the soldiers at the gate were extremely thorough. My extension box was seized. My ceramic mug was tagged as contraband. They emptied every corner of our bags before letting us through.

Inside the camp, we were taken to the Ajumobi Hostel, a large hall with rows of metal bunks. Felix got the top bunk; I took the bottom. The next challenge started almost immediately.

They asked for **original documents only**.
All I had were photocopies.

I rushed to the business center and paid ₦500 per page to print colored copies. By the time I finished, platoons were almost full. Felix ended up in Platoon 2. I got placed in Platoon 8.

### **Cold Mornings & Survival Tactics**

If you’ve never experienced Iseyin cold, it is serious. The 5 a.m. breeze went straight through our white shorts. I quickly noticed that the calmest period was when Muslims went for morning prayers, so I quietly followed them—not to pray, but to escape the cold wind.

Food was another survival issue. The camp beans were… unpredictable. I found a bread-and-tea woman in Mami Market who became my official breakfast plug.

### **The “Minister of Enjoyment” Phase**

I wasn’t interested in becoming a Parade Commander. Marching wasn’t my thing, and I didn’t pretend. I was always off-beat, and eventually, they left me alone. That gave me time freedom when many were still rehearsing on the field.

But I wasn’t completely inactive. I:

* Joined the **debate team** with my camp friend, Peace.
  Our lead speaker, Obinwa, was excellent, and we won third place.

* Participated in the **SAED ICT exhibition** even though I barely attended the training.
  Somehow, I still won third place.

* Became part of the **Data Evaluation Team**, where we sorted questionnaires and avoided unnecessary stress.

As camp was ending, a tech company visited for recruitment. I wrote their test, passed their interview, and they posted me to work with them in Ibadan.

I left camp feeling hopeful.

## **3. The Tech Job: Expectations vs. Reality**

I resumed on January 6th. The office looked impressive. They had just gotten Starlink, and the environment felt modern and promising. They even had a birthday culture where celebrants got free food and drinks.

But reality set in gradually.

The workload was heavy, and because I worked fast, I was constantly given more tasks. I was handling both mobile and web development with a laptop that wasn’t meeting up, yet they didn’t want to upgrade it.

Closing late became normal.
9 p.m. was not unusual.
I stopped going out.
I lost weight.
And most importantly—I felt drained.

One day, I looked at myself and just knew I needed a reset.

I finished all my tasks, documented everything properly, and kept a clean record. Then one week into the new month, I went to the office and resigned. I collected a rejection letter and walked out.

That single step restored my peace.

## **4. A New Direction: Freelancing, Learning, and Building Something of My Own**

After leaving the job, I needed a PPA that gave me breathing room. While I was figuring things out, Timothy reached out with a freelance project. He had a client who needed an MQL trading robot.

I had never written MQL before.

But I understood core programming logic, so I told him, “Let’s try.”

We learned, we built it, we solved problems, and the client was satisfied. That payment opened my eyes: I didn’t have to depend completely on an office job. I could build things for clients directly.

Eventually, NYSC posted me to a very large secondary school—over 300 JSS1 students in multiple arms. I knew it wasn’t for me. I requested another place and found a smaller, calmer school where I taught just **two days a week**.

The extra time allowed me and my friends to start a tech solutions agency. We began taking projects, doing real work, improving our skills, and building our own network.

It felt like something meaningful — something I owned.

## **Conclusion: What NYSC Truly Taught Me**

Looking back, my NYSC year wasn’t just about uniforms, drills, or tired parade grounds. It was a year that taught me:

* how to stay calm when things aren’t working,
* how to choose peace over pressure,
* how to trust my abilities,
* and how to take charge of my own path.

From registration stress to the cold of Iseyin, from a demanding tech job to building my own solutions, every part of the journey shaped me.

NYSC didn’t just give me memories—it gave me clarity.

Today, I’m building software, working with people, and growing a tech agency, but this time at a pace and structure that aligns with my life.
